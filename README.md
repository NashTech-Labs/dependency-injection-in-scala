# Dependency Injection in Scala

- This template is about Dependency Injection in Scala.
- Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself.
- The receiving object is called a client and the passed (that is, "injected") object is called a service.
- The code that passes the service to the client is called the injector.
